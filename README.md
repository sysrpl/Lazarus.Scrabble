# Lazarus.Scrabble

A demonstration showing how to create custom live visual controls for the Lazarus development environment.

## What is Lazarus Scrabble?

Lazarus Scrabble is a custom written control for the Lazarus development environment that implements the rules and visual styling of the popular Scrabble board game. The control can be maniplated within the IDE altering the board size, style, and behaviour. At run time the control enforces the rules of Scabble and allows users to visually place and move tiles on the game with smooth animations. 

This program is part of a greater computer programming studies course taught to children using resources and tools from the [getlazarus website](https://www.getlazarus.org/learn/).
